You have to build an Android application presenting this simple grid view. You don't need to take a special care about the UI but good taste will be well appreciate.

For the image and name you will use a dynamic collection based on this API: http://api.randomuser.me/?format=json&results=50

For JSON desrialization you can use this library: https://github.com/google/gson
