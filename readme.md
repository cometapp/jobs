# Comet jobs repository

You can find here the different challenges we use in the interview process at Comet.

## HOWTO

- Create a repository and complete the challenge, then give us access to your repo for review.

## What we expect

- Readable code. Make it clear, elegant, smart.
- Try not to add too many dependencies, we want to read your code, not some open source repo...
